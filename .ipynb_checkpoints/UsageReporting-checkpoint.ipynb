Intention is that the content acquired should be compatible with the ISO19115 MD_Usage element, as well as W3C Prov or [W3C Annotation](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/)  information models.\n",

    "\n",
    "* context:  some way of identifying the resource used, and ideally the software environment of application. Free text to start, ideally some machine-actionable encoding could be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "* specificUsage (annotationNote):  free text, describe how data were used\n",

    "* usageDateTime(annotationDateTime): time stamp, defaults to time that report is submitted to annotation server, also allow user-specified time when the usage was attempted (must be previous to the actual report time)\n",

    "* AnnotationID: unique identifier for this annotation, probably autogenerated UUID\n",
    "\n",
    "* subjectID: URI for resource that is subject of the annotation; could be dataset, metadata record, another annotation.  Should be a resolvable identifier that enables linking to the documented resource.\n",
